## Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Question Answering (QA) using Streamlit, FAISS, SentenceTransformer, and Google Gemini API.

The system allows users to ask questions about AI research papers (focused on transformer models), retrieves relevant chunks from preloaded PDFs, and generates detailed answers using Gemini.

# Task Name - Project: Healthcare Policy Sales Agent

**Last Updated:** 12/6/2025

## Overview

This assistant is designed to help users find the most suitable health insurance policies based on their personal and family healthcare needs. By collecting key details such as age, family type, number of dependents, and special requirements, the system intelligently matches user profiles with the best-fit insurance plans available in the dataset.

The assistant ensures personalized policy suggestions and clear explanations for each recommendation. It focuses solely on healthcare insurance coverage and is trained to respond only using the provided data.

# Task Name - Project: Building a Web Research Agent using the ReAct Pattern

**Last Updated:** 12/6/2025

# ReAct Web Research Agent

A Python-based ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent that researches a user-defined topic using the Gemini API for question generation and the Tavily API for web searches, compiling findings into a structured markdown report. This project fulfills the requirements of the "Building AI Agents from Scratch" assignment.

**Project Description:**

This project implements a web research agent following the ReAct pattern. The agent:

Generates 5-6 research questions using Google's Gemini API (Planning Phase).
Searches the web for answers using the Tavily API (Acting Phase).
Compiles a structured markdown report with a title, introduction, question sections, and conclusion.
The assignment requires integrating an LLM (Gemini) and a web search tool (Tavily) to automate research on topics like "Climate Change."

**Features:**

**Question Generation:** Uses Gemini API to create 5-6 diverse, well-structured research questions.
**Web Search:** Retrieves relevant web results (title and content) using Tavily API.
**Report Compilation:** Generates a markdown report (research_report.md) with organized findings.
**Modular Design:** Implements the ReAct pattern via a ReActAgent class.
**Error Handling:** Handles API failures and malformed responses gracefully.

**Requirements**

## Installation

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai tavily-python python-dotenv

Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key

Obtain keys from Google AI Studio (Gemini) and Tavily.

Run Commands

To run the script with the default topic ("Climate Change"):

python react_agent_gemini.py

To use a custom topic, modify the topic variable in react_agent_gemini.py:

topic = "Your Topic Here"  # e.g., "Artificial Intelligence"

The script generates a research_report.md file with the research findings.


```

**File Structure**

react_agent_gemini.py: Main script implementing the ReAct agent.

research_report.md: Generated markdown report (output).

.env: Environment file for API keys (not tracked in Git).

# Task Name - Project: Study Assistant for Quiz Question Generation

**Last Updated:** 13/6/2025

## Overview

The Study Assistant with Gemini AI is a web application designed to help students study more effectively. Users can upload a PDF file (e.g., study material or lecture notes), and the application will:

Extract text from the PDF.

Generate a concise summary of the content in 3-5 bullet points.

Create 3 multiple-choice quiz questions based on the summary, with answers displayed in the format Answer: b) Correct answer.

The application uses the Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash) for natural language processing tasks like summarization and question generation. It is built using Streamlit for the web interface, PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction, and LangChain for managing prompts and API interactions.

This project is ideal for students who want to quickly review key concepts and test their understanding through quizzes.

**Prerequisites**

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

Python: Version 3.8 or higher.

Google API Key: You need a Google API key to use the Gemini API. You can obtain one from Google AI Studio.

PDF File: A text-based PDF file to upload (e.g., Prompt_Engineering.pdf).

**Requirements**

## Installation

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade PyPDF2 langchain langchain-community google-generativeai langchain-google-genai python-dotenv streamlit

Set Up the .env File:

create env [ GOOGLE_API_KEY= Your Api key]

Run Commands

streamlit run study_assistant_gemini.py

```
