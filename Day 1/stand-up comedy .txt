For this assignment, I needed to create a 5-minute stand-up comedy set in English. Hereâ€™s the link to my assignment: [ https://chatgpt.com/share/6847bf61-9b94-8008-a093-e3a12e9458c0 ].

To do this, I followed a clear plan:

First, I used zero-shot prompting to come up with some funny, relatable jokes that match my own sense of humor.

Then, I used few-shot prompting by giving examples of the types of jokes I like. This helped improve the jokes and keep them in the same style.

Next, I used iterative prompting to make the jokes even funnier and smoother to perform.

I also used negative prompting to remove any jokes that felt forced, overused, or offensive. This made sure the set was original and good for everyone.

Finally, I put the jokes together into a 5-minute routine with smooth transitions and timing. I also added tips for performing the set well, including how to start strong and end with a good closing line.
