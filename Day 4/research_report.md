But unmanaged climate change threatens to set back that progress by damaging poverty eradication efforts worldwide, and disproportionately affecting the poorest regions and people. Climate risks disproportionately affect the poorest countries and people, who are more exposed and more vulnerable to their impacts. Such actions need to be complemented by measures to offset the costs on the poor and vulnerable across and within countries. By hitting the poorest hardest, climate change risks both increasing existing economic inequalities and causing people to fall into poverty.

# EPA Report Shows Disproportionate Impacts of Climate Change on Socially Vulnerable Populations in the United States Climate Change and Social Vulnerability in the United States: A Focus on Six Impact Sectors is one of the most advanced environmental justice studies to date that looks at how projected climate change impacts may be distributed across the American public. EPA’s new, peer-reviewed report shows the degree to which four socially vulnerable populations— defined based on income, educational attainment, race and ethnicity, and age—may be more exposed to the highest impacts of climate change. Today’s analysis will help further efforts being taken by the Biden Administration across the Federal government to advance environmental justice and to address the disproportionate impacts that climate change is having on vulnerable communities.

### Source 5: Social Dimensions of Climate Change - World Bank Group
The Bank adopts a whole-of-society approach, working with national and local governments, civil society, grassroots communities, and other partners to strengthen social resilience at the ground level, where the effects of climate change are typically felt the most, and to promote meaningful engagement of all stakeholders in climate change decision-making and action. Channeling resources and decision-making power to support locally led climate action: Supporting devolved climate finance and community and local development approaches that empower communities to drive a climate agenda in support of their development goals; promoting greater transparency and accountability on climate finance; aligning and linking locally led climate action to national climate change priorities and strategies; supporting work to strengthen M&E of resilience and adaptation; and supporting financial inclusion for better and resilient jobs are all critical components.

## How are different ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, forests, arctic tundra) responding to climate change, and what are the potential cascading effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services?
### Source 1: Climate change effects on biodiversity, ecosystems, ecosystem services ...
Climate change affects individual species and the way they interact with other organisms and their habitats, which alters the structure and function of ecosystems and the goods and services that natural systems provide to society (Díaz et al., 2019). Periodic assessments of current and future climate change impacts on ecosystems are important for developing and updating natural resource management plans and evaluating adaptation actions (West et al., 2009). We provide a more in-depth, technical analysis of topics of interest to scientists and practitioners, and review climate change impacts at multiple scales, including: 1) the individual organisms, populations, and species of biodiversity which comprise ecosystems; 2) the properties and processes that characterize ecosystems; and 3) the goods and services that ecosystems provide which support human economies and well-being (Fig. 1).

### Source 2: Ecosystems, Ecosystem Services, and Biodiversity
The ability to predict ecological responses to changing climate conditions remains a key gap for most ecosystems because of complex interactions among species, the potential for adaptation (through both evolutionary responses and human activity), and the intersection of climate change with other drivers of change.36,285,286 For example, warmer temperatures can lead not only to increased forest regeneration and tree growth but also to increased mortality of older trees through wildfires, insects, and disease, with the resulting net impacts highly uncertain.287 Warmer winters are generally expected to benefit forest pests,288 but complex interactions among pests, their hosts, and other disturbances can make the combined effects more muted than otherwise expected.289,290,291 Recent research suggests that multiple disturbances can have counteracting effects, although patterns are not always clear, and sometimes intensified combined effects (synergies) also occur.292,293

Climate Change Impacts on Ecosystems | US EPA Climate Change Impacts on Ecosystems People are taking many actions to help ecosystems adapt to climate change impacts or minimize the effects. Climate change affects ecosystems at multiple levels, from the populations that make up ecosystems to the services they provide to communities, economies, and people. EPA’s Seasonality and Climate Change report walks through four main themes threatening ecosystems in the United States. Climate change is affecting some of the critical services that ecosystems provide to society.13 For example, ecosystems provide a bounty of food to people. We can limit climate change’s impacts on ecosystems in several ways, including the following:

Top 10 Innovations in Carbon Capture Technology You Should Know Ocean-Based Carbon Capture: Harnessing the Blue Planet’s Power By working with the rhythms of the sea, ocean-based carbon capture could become a vital piece of our climate solution puzzle. But new carbon capture technologies are offering hope. Technologies like post-combustion capture grab CO2 from flue gases, while oxy-fuel combustion burns fuel in pure oxygen, making it easier to separate out the carbon. As the world shifts toward renewable energy, carbon capture allows existing plants to bridge the gap—cutting emissions while new technologies scale up. This partnership between public policy and private innovation is fueling a race to make carbon capture mainstream, affordable, and effective everywhere.

It is noteworthy that if carbon capture and storage technologies are not taken into consideration, the cost of lowering emissions will increase drastically by 140% (Kearns et al., 2021). Pre-combustion carbon capture (Hua et al., 2023). Post-combustion carbon capture technologies (Chao et al., 2021). Physical or chemical absorption procedures can be used to separate the H2 and CO2 combination in the pre-combustion process by syngas scrubbing with a liquid solvent that is selective to carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide as acid compounds (Kheirinik et al., 2021). Post-combustion carbon capture is a technology that uses physical or chemical adsorption/absorption techniques to extract CO2 and other gases from burning fossil fuel resources (Chao et al., 2021).
